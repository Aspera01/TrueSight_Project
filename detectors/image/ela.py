"""
Error Level Analysis (ELA) Detector
------------------------------------
ELA reveals image manipulation by re-saving the image at a known JPEG quality
and comparing the difference. Authentic images have uniform error levels;
manipulated regions show distinctly higher or lower error patterns.

No external model required — pure signal processing.
